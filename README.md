# DG-for-NLSW
An energy-based discontinuous galerkin method for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with wave operator

Time discretization: strong stability preseving runge kutta methods, five stage fourth order

## One-dimensional case
1. linear case: initial condition not 0, convergence study
2. linear case: initial condition 0, convergence study
3. nonlinear case: beta coefficient
4. nonlinear case: capture the oscillation

## Two-dimensional case
1. linear case: wave equation
